                        <h1 id="what-is-craftcoin"><a class="header" href="#what-is-craftcoin">What is CraftCoin</a></h1>
<p>CraftCoin (CRAFT) is a cryptocurrency for a new Minecraft ecosystem for
players, server owners, developers and creators. Having a crypto wallet is
completely optional, players can play without a crypto wallet and connect
it at any time.</p>
<h2 id="goals"><a class="header" href="#goals">Goals</a></h2>
<p>Our goal is mass adoption of crypto. A lot of people still think that
crypto is a scam, NFTs are just useless images (and also a scam), and we
want to prove opposite by building an ecosystem that makes use of
cryptocurrency, NFTs and smart contracts.</p>
<h2 id="tokenomics"><a class="header" href="#tokenomics">Tokenomics</a></h2>
<p>The initial and total supply is 1,000,000,000 CRAFT:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% – Staking rewards, APY: 50% (subject to change by DAO)</li>
<li>25% – Liquidity rewards, 1 CRAFT is released every second (subject to
change by DAO)</li>
<li>25% – Private and public sale</li>
<li>20% – DAO treasury (for things like promotion campaigns, bug bounties,
grants, contributor rewards, etc.)</li>
<li>5% – Contributor rewards (to be used before DAO is implemented)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may notice that there’s no “Team” allocation. That’s because we want to
create a DAO as soon as possible, and we already treat our team as
full-time paid contributors (including the founder). Minecraft has an
awesome community of players and developers that made software such as
Spigot possible, and I believe it doesn’t need one company that owns it
all.</p>
<h2 id="why-minecraft"><a class="header" href="#why-minecraft">Why Minecraft?</a></h2>
<p>Mostly because it’s just a cool game that our founder likes. But also it’s
the most sold game ever, with hundreds of millions of downloads, thousands
of servers and developers around the world. Minecraft has all capabilities
to have a good crypto ecosystem, a lot of plugins and gamemodes for
interesting gameplay, which is the main p2e problem, is already here, and
available for free! Minecraft has always been a metaverse, players create
their own currencies on each servers, and sometimes even create black
markets, which is really unsafe, and we’re here to solve this problem.</p>
<p>Minecraft doesn’t have a “central server” where everyone plays, instead
anyone can create their own server, add plugins and/or mods, invite friends
and play the way they want, so it’s somewhat decentralized. But every
server is under admin’s control, so we have a lot of centralized servers,
but the game itself is not centralized.</p>
<h2 id="is-it-a-ponzi"><a class="header" href="#is-it-a-ponzi">Is it a ponzi?</a></h2>
<p>It depends on the server, but usually no. In The Diamondverse, the
play-to-earn model is mostly selling NFTs to pay-to-win players, who are
willing to spend money to have more fun on a server. While the income is
not consistent, it’s simple and fair. When players want to make money,
investors want to make money, developers want to make money, everyone wants
to make money at the same time, someone must lose money because we can’t
just get money out of nowhere, so pay-to-win players is the way. They spend
money, but they don’t lose money, so it’s a win-win solution.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="getting-started"><a class="header" href="#getting-started">Getting started</a></h1>
<p>CraftCoin is not a server, it’s an ecosystem of servers, plugins and dapps,
where anyone can create a server, add or code plugins, and run it. We have
our own server called The Diamondverse, but it’s just the first server
where we test plugins and showcase progress.</p>
<p>The Diamondverse will launch in testnet mode in Q3 2022 and you can get
testnet CRAFT by running <code>/airdrop</code> command (available only once). Then you
can get CRAFT in daily login rewards, voting rewards, challenges and other
in-game rewards. It will change when we move to mainnet and new CRAFT
tokens will have real world value. We decided to limit testnet CRAFT
because we still need to have a balanced economy so it’s interesting to
play and test. Most active testnet players will eventually receive mainnet
airdrops or other rewards. If you’re interested in testing The Diamondverse
on testnet, see <a href="./testing-the-diamondverse.html">Testing The Diamondverse</a>
page.</p>
<h2 id="faq"><a class="header" href="#faq">FAQ</a></h2>
<p>We don’t have FAQ because the server hasn’t launched yet.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="for-server-owners"><a class="header" href="#for-server-owners">For server owners</a></h1>
<p>You can easily monetize your server with CraftCoin. You don’t need to build
a website, integrate payment systems, you just need a plugin and a smart
contract (right now you need a developer for this, but in future there’ll
be more user-friendly solutions). But it doesn’t mean you don’t have to pay
taxes. How crypto taxes work depends on your country, so contact your
lawyer if you have any questions. </p>
<h2 id="nfts"><a class="header" href="#nfts">NFTs</a></h2>
<p>NFTs are tokens that may have the ability to be bought, sold, transferred,
have metadata, basically everything that you can imagine and code. For
example, you can have SkyBlock islands, WorldGuard regions, ranks, battle
pass, diamond sword with custom enchantments, server access pass,
non-transferable identity NFTs, cosmetics (except for capes), crafting
recipes, SkyWars kits, almost any in-game asset.</p>
<p>You can pre-mint a fixed supply and sell them on marketplaces such as
OpenSea, make a minting command or website where anyone can mint NFTs
for a fixed price, or even have custom minting algorithms with plugins or
smart contracts.</p>
<p>You can also set a creator fee so you get some money every time someone
buys / sells your server’s NFT.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="for-players"><a class="header" href="#for-players">For players</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to the crypto space! At CraftCoin, we believe that cryptocurrencies
is the future of money, as well as gaming.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-crypto"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-crypto">How to use crypto?</a></h2>
<p>To create a crypto wallet, you need to just download a crypto wallet from
your phone’s app store. You don’t need to go anywhere, confirm your
address, phone number, even your real name. Just download – and you’re
done. For every operation you need at least a fraction of a penny in MATIC
(another cryptocurrency, but it’s not only for gaming) in your wallet,
we’ll tell you how to get it (for free) later.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-nft"><a class="header" href="#what-is-nft">What is NFT?</a></h2>
<p>Unlike what some people think, NFTs are not just useless pictures or links.
Most NFTs have a utility. Some are used in games, others give access to a
product, closed community, or other benefits. For example, if you have
<code>DIAMOND RANK</code> NFT in your wallet, you have <strong>[DIAMOND]</strong> rank on The
Diamondverse and have access to more in-game features. Some NFTs give you
access to additional game features, others are just collectibles, but one
thing is clear: if you don’t think this NFT is worth buying, then don’t buy
it.</p>
<h2 id="crypto-is-a-scam"><a class="header" href="#crypto-is-a-scam">Crypto is a scam</a></h2>
<p>Unlike popular myths, it’s not. Yes, there are a lot of scams in crypto,
but in general, crypto is not a scam. There are also scams in fiat (“real”
money), that’s how our world works. Crypto is a completely new world with
new types of scams, and some of the most popular ones are listed below.
Actually, crypto is safer than traditional banks because you don’t need to
trust anyone and enter your confidential information (like card numbers),
just keep your seed phrase safe and nothing bad will happen.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-avoid-scams"><a class="header" href="#how-to-avoid-scams">How to avoid scams?</a></h3>
<p>To access a server or a dapp (decentralized app) you need to connect your
wallet using a QR code. You can connect to any QR code, it’s completely
safe, but be aware of these things:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you perform a transaction, a small (usually less than $0.01)
transaction fee in MATIC is taken from your balance, it’s OK. You are
safe to send any transaction unless:
<ul>
<li>The transaction is “Approve”. It means you allow to spend some of
your tokens, sometimes it’s infinity. Always look at the amount and
check if you trust the developer. If you’re trying to get a free
NFT and the server wants 1000000000 CRAFT approval, it’s probably a
scam.</li>
<li>The transaction is “Transfer”. It means you’re going to transfer your
tokens to the server or a developer. Again, only confirm this
transaction if you trust the developer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fake NFTs. Don’t <strong>search</strong> NFT collections, use official links from
server, server’s website, discord or any other official source, anyone
can create NFTs with any name, picture and description they want.</li>
<li>Scam tokens. Unless you know what you’re doing and what you’re going to
buy, you probably don’t need to buy tokens other than CRAFT and MATIC.</li>
<li>DM scammers. Don’t send them your seed phrase! Your 12 words (or
Private Key) is your access to your wallet, don’t show them if someone
asks you. Even if they’re claiming to be CraftCoin support.</li>
<li>Fake giveaways. There’s a lot of YouTube livestreams with Elon Musk or
other famous people who ask you to send your crypto and get 2x more. I
know it’s obvious for most of you, but there are people who actually
lose money on this.</li>
<li>Fake websites. Make sure you don’t make a typo in a website’s address.
Use bookmarks if you want to be 100% sure. By the way, if you follow the
rules from <code>1</code>, you should be safe browsing fake websites.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="starting-without-investment"><a class="header" href="#starting-without-investment">Starting without investment</a></h2>
<p>Your first step would be obtaining NFTs from servers. You can do it in
different ways, depending on server where you play. If you have earned your
NFT but can’t claim it (because your balance is 0 and you don’t want to buy
crypto), ask us at Discord and we’ll help you. Then you can sell your NFT
for CRAFT, exchange CRAFT for MATIC and now you have enough MATIC for your
future needs. We would appreciate if you donate some MATIC to other players
in Discord who need some.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Right now we’re playing in testing mode and MATIC and CRAFT are free! If
you’re using <a href="https://testwallet.craftcoin.tech">our test wallet</a>, click
the “Get MATIC” button on the top of the page.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="for-play-to-earn-gamers"><a class="header" href="#for-play-to-earn-gamers">For play-to-earn gamers</a></h1>
<p>Welcome to Minecraft. In order to get started, you need to buy Minecraft
from https://minecraft.net and find a server to play. Right now we have our
own server for testing called The Diamondverse, and it will be launched on
testnet soon. We might airdrop some real tokens for most active testnet
players and contributors after IDO, but that decision will be made by DAO.</p>
<h2 id="traditional-game-modes"><a class="header" href="#traditional-game-modes">Traditional game modes</a></h2>
<p>Minecraft players have advantage over those who haven’t played Minecraft
before, which is pretty fair given that our games depend mostly on skill.
In play-to-earn games you can make money by either gambling, ponzi schemes
or skill-based games, and we decided to choose the last option. By the way,
gambling is banned by Minecraft EULA.</p>
<h2 id="play-to-earn-game-modes"><a class="header" href="#play-to-earn-game-modes">Play-to-earn game modes</a></h2>
<p>While at The Diamondverse we don’t have play-to-earn based game modes, we
have integrated play-to-earn mechanics into traditional game modes. For
example, we have a skyblock mode where islands are NFTs, we have burnable
island expansion NFTs, you can wrap your items into NFTs, buy/sell and
unwrap into in-game items, and there’s more to come.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="for-developers"><a class="header" href="#for-developers">For Developers</a></h1>
<p>If you want to develop crypto plugins that use NFTs or smart contracts, you
need to know 2 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to code plugins</li>
<li>How to code smart contracts</li>
</ul>
<p>We don’t have API docs yet, because API is still not stable, but we’re
working on it. We use <a href="https://docs.web3j.io/4.8.7/quickstart/">Web3j</a> and
<a href="https://docs.walletconnect.com/">WalletConnect</a> for most web3
interactions. WalletConnect integration is handled by <a href="https://github.com/CraftToken/WalletConnectMC">WalletConnectMC</a>
plugin and its API.</p>
<p>Right now we need contributors and servers, later we will have a plugin
marketplace and grants for servers. Also, contributors may receive rewards
like NFTs they created, or some amount of CRAFT, but contributor rewards
are not guaranteed. Until the DAO is implemented, the founder will decide
how much should we pay every contributor individually.</p>

A new DAO platform with richer proposals: yes/no <strong>WITH</strong> multiple
options, number input, multiple numbers/yes/no, that is built for
players and frequent usage, like choosing “building of the week” (its
author will receive CRAFT) or choosing how much we should pay our
contributors.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"/>
Player-bound non-transferable NFT that will be used for voting along
with staked CRAFT. They will be given to everyone who has a genuine
paid version of Minecraft. Maybe we’ll add other player-bound NFTs that
will increase player’s voting power and manually give it to active
community members.</li>

<p>Testing is one of the most important things in game development, especially
in public testing phase, so we want to reward most active testers with
Tester NFT. Tester NFT will be only available at the testnet stage of The
Diamondverse and it will grant early access to the new game modes and
updates of The Diamondverse after its mainnet release. Also, these NFTs have
a level that will increase for every bug that you find. More points = more
rewards.</p>

<p>We have a <a href="https://testwallet.craftcoin.tech">test wallet</a> that can be used
for testing. You don’t even need to download it, it’s right in your browser.</p>
