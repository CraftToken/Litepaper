# For server owners

You can easily monetize your server with CraftCoin. You don't need to build
a website, integrate payment systems, you just need a plugin and a smart
contract (right now you need a developer for this, but in future there'll
be more user-friendly solutions). But it doesn't mean you don't have to pay
taxes. How crypto taxes work depends on your country, so contact your
lawyer if you have any questions. 

## NFTs

NFTs are tokens that may have the ability to be bought, sold, transferred,
have metadata, basically everything that you can imagine and code. For
example, you can have SkyBlock islands, WorldGuard regions, ranks, battle
pass, diamond sword with custom enchantments, server access pass,
non-transferable identity NFTs, cosmetics (except for capes), crafting
recipes, SkyWars kits, almost any in-game asset.

You can pre-mint a fixed supply and sell them on marketplaces such as
OpenSea, make a minting command or website where anyone can mint NFTs
for a fixed price, or even have custom minting algorithms with plugins or
smart contracts.

You can also set a creator fee so you get some money every time someone
buys / sells your server's NFT.
