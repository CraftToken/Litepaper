# For play-to-earn gamers
Welcome to Minecraft. In order to get started, you need to buy Minecraft
from https://minecraft.net and find a server to play. Right now we have our
own server for testing called The Diamondverse, and it will be launched on
testnet soon. We might airdrop some real tokens for most active testnet
players and contributors after IDO, but that decision will be made by DAO.

## Traditional game modes
Minecraft players have advantage over those who haven't played Minecraft
before, which is pretty fair given that our games depend mostly on skill.
In play-to-earn games you can make money by either gambling, ponzi schemes
or skill-based games, and we decided to choose the last option. By the way,
gambling is banned by Minecraft EULA.

## Play-to-earn game modes
While at The Diamondverse we don't have play-to-earn based game modes, we
have integrated play-to-earn mechanics into traditional game modes. For
example, we have a skyblock mode where islands are NFTs, we have burnable
island expansion NFTs, you can wrap your items into NFTs, buy/sell and
unwrap into in-game items, and there's more to come.
