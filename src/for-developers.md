# For Developers
If you want to develop crypto plugins that use NFTs or smart contracts, you
need to know 2 things:
- How to code plugins
- How to code smart contracts

We don't have API docs yet, because API is still not stable.

Right now we need contributors and servers, later we will have a plugin
marketplace and grants for servers. Also, contributors may receive rewards
like NFTs they created, or just some amount of CRAFT.
