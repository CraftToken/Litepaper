# For Developers
If you want to develop crypto plugins that use NFTs or smart contracts, you
need to know 2 things:
- How to code plugins
- How to code smart contracts

We don't have API docs yet, because API is still not stable, but we're
working on it. We use [Web3j](https://docs.web3j.io/4.8.7/quickstart/) and
[WalletConnect](https://docs.walletconnect.com/) for most web3
interactions. WalletConnect integration is handled by [WalletConnectMC](https://github.com/CraftToken/WalletConnectMC)
plugin and its API.

Right now we need contributors and servers, later we will have a plugin
marketplace and grants for servers. Also, contributors may receive rewards
like NFTs they created, or some amount of CRAFT, but contributor rewards
are not guaranteed. Until the DAO is implemented, the founder will decide
how much should we pay every contributor individually.
