# Testing The Diamondverse (not available yet)

Testing is one of the most important things in game development, especially
in public testing phase, so we want to reward most active testers with
Tester NFT. Tester NFT will be only available at the testnet stage of The
Diamondverse and it will grant early access to the new game modes and
updates of The Diamondverse after its mainnet release. Also, these NFTs have
a level that will increase for every bug that you find. Bigger level =
bigger rewards.

## Test wallet
We have a [test wallet](https://testwallet.craftcoin.tech) that can be used
for testing. You don't even need to download it, it's right in your browser.
