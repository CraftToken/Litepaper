# Getting started

CraftCoin is not a server, it's an ecosystem of servers, plugins and dapps,
where anyone can create a server. We have our own server called The
Diamondverse, but it's just the first server where we test plugins and
showcase progress.

The Diamondverse will launch in testnet mode in Q3 2022 and you can get
testnet CRAFT by running `/airdrop` command. The first time you'll get 10k
CRAFT, then 100 CRAFT per day + daily login rewards. We decided to do it
because we still need to have a balanced economy so it's interesting to
play and test. Most active testnet players will eventually receive mainnet
airdrops or other rewards. If you're interested in testing The Diamondverse
on testnet, see [Testing The Diamondverse](./testing-the-diamondverse.md)
page.

## FAQ
We don't have FAQ because the server hasn't been launched yet.
