# Getting started

CraftCoin is not a server, it's an ecosystem of servers, plugins and dapps,
where anyone can create a server, add or code plugins, and run it. We have
our own server called The Diamondverse, but it's just the first server
where we test plugins and showcase progress.

The Diamondverse will launch in testnet mode in Q3 2022 and you can get
testnet CRAFT by running `/airdrop` command (available only once). Then you
can get CRAFT in daily login rewards, voting rewards, challenges and other
in-game rewards. It will change when we move to mainnet and new CRAFT
tokens will have real world value. We decided to limit testnet CRAFT
because we still need to have a balanced economy so it's interesting to
play and test. Most active testnet players will eventually receive mainnet
airdrops or other rewards. If you're interested in testing The Diamondverse
on testnet, see [Testing The Diamondverse](./testing-the-diamondverse.md)
page.

## FAQ
We don't have FAQ because the server hasn't launched yet.
