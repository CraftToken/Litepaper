# What is CraftCoin
CraftCoin (CRAFT) is a cryptocurrency for a new Minecraft ecosystem for
players, server owners, developers and creators. Having a crypto wallet is
completely optional, players can play without a crypto wallet and connect
it at any time.

## Goals
Our goal is mass adoption of crypto. A lot of people still think that
crypto is a scam, NFTs are just useless images (and also a scam), and we
want to prove opposite by building an ecosystem that makes use of
cryptocurrency, NFTs and smart contracts.

## Tokenomics
The initial and total supply is 1,000,000,000 CRAFT:
- 25% -- Staking rewards, APY: 50% (subject to change by DAO)
- 25% -- Liquidity rewards, 1 CRAFT is released every second (subject to
  change by DAO)
- 25% -- Private and public sale
- 20% -- DAO treasury (for things like promotion campaigns, bug bounties,
grants, contributor rewards, etc.)
- 5% -- Contributor rewards (to be used before DAO is implemented)

You may see that there's no "Team" allocation. That's because we want to
create a DAO as soon as possible, and we already treat our team as
full-time paid contributors (including me, the founder). Minecraft has an
awesome community of players and developers that made software such as
Spigot possible, and I believe it doesn't need one company that owns it
all.

## Why Minecraft?
Mostly because it's just a cool game that our founder likes. But also it's
the most sold game ever, with hundreds of millions of downloads, so even if
we reach 1% of the players, it would be a huge success! Minecraft has all
capabilities to have a good crypto ecosystem, a lot of plugins and
gamemodes for interesting gameplay, which is the main p2e problem, is
already here, and available for free! Minecraft has always been a
metaverse, players create their own currencies on each servers, and
sometimes even create black markets, which is really unsafe, and we're here
to solve this problem.

Minecraft doesn't have a "central server" where everyone plays, instead
anyone can create their own server, add plugins and/or mods, invite friends
and play the way you want, so it's somewhat decentralized. But every server
is under admin's control, so we have a lot of centralized servers, but the
game itself is not centralized.

## Is it a ponzi?
It depends on the server, but usually no. In The Diamondverse, the
play-to-earn model is mostly selling NFTs to pay-to-win players, who are
willing to spend money while having fun on a server. While the income is
not consistent, it's fair. When players want to make money, investors want
to make money, developers want to make money, everyone wants to make money
at the same time, someone must lose money because we can't just get money
out of nowhere, so pay-to-win players is the way. They spend money, but
they don't lose money, so it's a win-win solution.
