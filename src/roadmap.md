# Roadmap

## Q2 2022
1. [x] WalletConnect integration, essential plugins for building a crypto
   server.

## Q3 2022

2. [ ] Launch The Diamondverse on testnet -- the first server to adopt
   CRAFT. If we want a community to adopt CRAFT, we need to do it ourselves
   to see possible pitfalls and provide integration examples.
3. [ ] Write all plugins listed [here](./for-server-owners.md#plugins).
4. [ ] Stabilize APIs, write technical documentation, some plugin examples.
5. [ ] Cross-server on-chain guilds and friends system.
6. [ ] Player profile dapp.

## Q4 2022

7. [ ] Fork some crypto wallet to improve gaming experience (player profile,
   built-in NFT marketplace, off-chain data providers, improved security).
8. [ ] Create a DAO.
9. [ ] Move The Diamondverse to mainnet (or create Diamondverse 2.0).
10. [ ] Grants for servers and minecraft-specific dapps.
11. [ ] Partnerships with existing Minecraft servers.

## 2023

12. [ ] Plugin marketplace or a category in an existing plugin repository.
13. [ ] A new DAO platform with richer proposals: yes/no **WITH** multiple
    options, number input, multiple numbers/yes/no, that is built for
    players and frequent usage, like choosing "building of the week" (its
    author will receive CRAFT) or choosing how much we should pay our
    contributors.
14. [ ] Player-bound non-transferable NFT that will be used for voting along
    with staked CRAFT. They will be given to everyone who has a genuine
    paid version of Minecraft. Maybe we'll add other player-bound NFTs that
    will increase player's voting power and manually give it to active
    community members.
